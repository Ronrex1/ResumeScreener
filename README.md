## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the file `UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv`. The dataset contains two columns: `Resume` (text data) and `Category` (labels).

## Code Structure

- `resume_screening_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the resume screening model.
- `UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used by the model.

## Dependencies

The code requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
